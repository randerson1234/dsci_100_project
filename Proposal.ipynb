    "High blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and resting heart rate are some of the main predictors of heart disease (CDC). Blood pressure, when too high, can put stress on the arteries in addition to organs such as the heart and kidneys. Cholesterol is a fat-like substance that can build up on the walls of the arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart. These variables can be changed via medications or lifestyle changes and are therefore worth studying as predictors of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be trying to find which of the well known predictors of heart disease have the greatest impact on presence. To do this we are using the Heart Disease Dataset which contains variables of sex, age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking status.\n"

    "After cleaning the data and retaining columns for each of our variables, we will split the dataset by sex. We will perform a classification using each variable for one sex and compare the accuracies of each model for that sex. Each classification will start with a training dataset that will be used to create a recipe. We will perform 5-fold cross-validation on the training set in order to find the best k value. Then, we'll build a model using that k value and the training dataset. Finally, we'll use that model to pass the testing dataset through and evaluate its' accuracy. This process will be repeated for each variable for males and then each variable for females.\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "We will visualize results with bar plots that represent the accuracy of each variable, separated by sex. This will demonstrate which variables are best at predicting a diagnosis of heart disease and highlight any discrepancies between sexes. Additionally, we will have confusion matrixes for each variable. We will also have tibbles with each variables' accuracy for each sex. \n",
